Ex1

1.1

a. After the ball collides with the paddle, it will keeps shaking there and after a few sec, the ball will finally be reflected.

I find this problem when I watch the unatural movement of ball after it collides with paddle. I finally add a variable to control the status of the paddle which successfully solve the problem.

b. Unnatural ball movement after collision.

I find the problem also by wathing the movement of ball after collision with bricks. I finally find that the reflection calculating equation is wrong. And with correct equation, the movement becomes natural.

c. Once the reflection angle of the ball becomes 90 degree, then the ball will keeps moving upward and downward without any movement to left or right.

I find the problem after several trials of playing the game. At some time, I found that it was likely the the reflection angle is 90 degrees, which will lead to consequent lots of 90 degrees. That means such situation must be avoid, so I add more judgements to avoid the 90-degree reflection.

2.In project 2, I will follow Traffic Principle to debug. Whenever I find bugs, I will first track problems, then reproduce it, automate it and after that, find the origin, focus and isolate circumstances and finally correct it. I think the Traffic Principle will greatly enhance the debugging efficiency.

3.All the information the vendor needs to fix the problem. The product release, the operating environment, the problem history, expected and experienced behavior, a one-line summary

**ex2**

In ex2, bugs in the game are fixed including the infinite loop, the invisible blasters, the stopped animation.

Three bug reports have been created.
