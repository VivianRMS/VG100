## Usage
### _Basic Game Operations:_
Use $\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$ on the keyboard to manipulate the paddle.

Use R on the keyboard to respawn and have another try.

### _About how to Play the Game:_
1. Press the `Start` button on the left.
2. Use the arrows on the keyboard to control the paddle to catch the ball and let it bounce to break the bricks on the top. Make sure that the ball does not fall off.
3. Use the paddle to adjust the angle of the ball such that you can find the key before the bricks have fallen to the lowest ground.
4. You can adjust the volume of the BGM and other SFX by pressing the `up-arrow`, which is for turning up, and `down-arrow`, which is for turning down. You can also completely stop the music by pressing `=`, and pressing again will resume it.
5. You can press `P` to pause and `R` to resume
